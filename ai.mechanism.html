       <h3>Can machines think? â€” Alan Turing, 1950</h3>
       <P>Not exactly 10 years in the wake of breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a straightforward inquiry: "Can machines think?" 

        Turing's paper "Registering Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's resulting Turing Test, built up the basic objective and vision of man-made reasoning. 
        
        what is fake intelligenceAt it's center, AI is the part of software engineering that expects to respond to Turing's inquiry in the confirmed. It is the undertaking to imitate or reproduce human knowledge in machines. 
        
        The sweeping objective of computerized reasoning has offered ascend to numerous inquiries and discussions. To such an extent, that no solitary meaning of the field is all around acknowledged. 
        
        The significant constraint in characterizing AI as essentially "building machines that are insightful" is that it doesn't really clarify what computerized reasoning is? What makes a machine shrewd? 
        
        In their earth shattering reading material Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, writers Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the inquiry by binding together their work around the topic of insightful specialists in machines. Considering this, AI is "the investigation of specialists that get percepts from the earth and perform activities." (Russel and Norvig viii) 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Norvig and Russell proceed to investigate four distinct methodologies that have generally characterized the field of AI:

        <ul>
            <li>Thinking humanly</li>
            <li>Thinking rationally</li>
            <li>Acting humanly</li>
            <li>Acting rationally</li>                       
        </ul>
