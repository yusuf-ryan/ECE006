            <h1>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI)
            </h1>
    
            <h2><span>Commuting</span></h2>
            <p>As indicated by a 2015 report by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, drive times in the US have been consistently climbing year-over-year, bringing about 42 hours of heavy traffic delay per suburbanite in 2014—in excess of a full work week out of each year, with an expected $160 billion in lost efficiency. Plainly, there's enormous open door here for AI to make a substantial, obvious effect in each individual's life. 

                Decreasing drive times is no straightforward issue to tackle. A solitary excursion may include different methods of transportation (for example heading to a train station, riding the train to the ideal stop, and afterward strolling or utilizing a ride-share administration from that stop to the last goal), also the normal and the unforeseen: development; mishaps; street or track support; and climate conditions can tighten traffic stream with practically zero notification. Besides, long haul patterns may not coordinate verifiable information, contingent upon the adjustments in populace check and socioeconomics, neighborhood financial matters, and zoning approaches. Here's the manner by which AI is as of now assisting with handling the complexities of transportation.</p>
            <h3><span>1 -  Google’s AI-Powered Predictions</span></h3>
            <P>Using anonymized location data from smartphones, Google Maps (Maps) can analyze the speed of movement of traffic at any given time. And, with its acquisition of crowdsourced traffic app Waze in 2013, Maps can more easily incorporate user-reported traffic incidents like construction and accidents. Access to vast amounts of data being fed to its proprietary algorithms means Maps can reduce  commutes by suggesting the fastest routes to and from work.</P>
            <h3><span>2 -  Ridesharing Apps Like Uber and Lyft</span></h3>
            <p>How do they determine the price of your ride? How do they minimize the wait time once you hail a car? How do these services optimally match you with other passengers to minimize detours? The answer to all these questions is ML.

                Engineering Lead for Uber ATC  Jeff Schneider discussed in an NPR interview how the company uses ML to predict rider demand to ensure that “surge pricing”(short periods of sharp price increases to decrease rider demand and increase driver supply) will soon no longer be necessary. Uber’s Head of Machine Learning Danny Lange confirmed Uber’s use of machine learning for ETAs for rides, estimated meal delivery times on UberEATS, computing optimal pickup locations, as well as for fraud detection.

            <h3><span>3 - Commercial Flights Use an AI Autopilot</span></h3>
            <p>AI autopilots in commercial airlines is a  surprisingly early use of AI technology that dates as far back as 1914, depending on how loosely you define autopilot. The New York Times reports that the average flight of a Boeing plane involves only seven minutes of human-steered flight, which is typically reserved only for takeoff and landing.</p>

            <h2><span>Email</span></h2>
            <h3><span>1 – Spam Filters </span></h3>
            <P>Your email inbox seems like an unlikely place for AI, but the technology is largely powering one of its most important features: the spam filter. Simple rules-based filters (i.e. “filter out messages with the words ‘online pharmacy’ and ‘Nigerian prince’ that come from unknown addresses”) aren’t effective against spam, because spammers can quickly update their messages to work around them. Instead, spam filters must continuously learn from a variety of signals, such as the words in the message, message metadata (where it’s sent from, who sent it, etc.).

                It must further personalize its results based on your own definition of what constitutes spam—perhaps that daily deals email that you consider spam is a welcome sight in the inboxes of others. Through the use of machine learning algorithms, Gmail successfully filters 99.9% of spam.
            </P>
            <h3><span>2 – Smart Email Categorization</span></h3>
            <P>Gmail uses a similar approach to categorize your emails into primary, social, and promotion inboxes, as well as labeling emails as important. In a research paper titled, “The Learning Behind Gmail Priority Inbox”, Google outlines its machine learning approach and notes “a huge variation between user preferences for volume of important mail…Thus, we need some manual intervention from users to tune their threshold. When a user marks messages in a consistent direction, we perform a real-time increment to their threshold.” Every time you mark an email as important, Gmail learns. The researchers tested the effectiveness of Priority Inbox on Google employees and found that those with Priority Inbox “spent 6% less time reading email overall, and 13% less time reading unimportant email.”</P>
            <h2><span>Social Networking</span></h2>
            <h3><span>1 – Facebook</span></h3>
            <P>When you upload photos to Facebook, the service automatically highlights faces and suggests friends

                to
                
                tag. How can it instantly identify which of your friends is in the photo? Facebook uses AI to recognize faces. In a short video highlighting their AI research (below), Facebook discusses the use of artificial neural networks—ML algorithms that mimic the structure of the human brain—to power facial recognition software. The company has invested heavily in this area not only within Facebook, but also through the acquisitions of facial-recognition startups like Face.com, which Facebook acquired in 2012 for a rumored $60M, Masquerade (2016, undisclosed sum),  and Faciometrics (2016, undisclosed sum).
                Facebook also uses AI to personalize your newsfeed and ensure you’re seeing posts that interest you, as discussed in an Emerj interview with Facebook’s Hussein Mehanna. And, of particular business interest to Facebook is showing ads that are relevant to your interests. Better targeted ads mean you’re more likely to click them and buy something from the advertisers—and when you do, Facebook gets paid. In the first quarter of 2016, Facebook and Google secured a total of 85% of the online ad market—precisely because of deeply-targeted advertisements.

In June 2016, Facebook announced a new AI initiative: DeepText, a text understanding engine that, the company claims “can understand with near-human accuracy the textual content of several thousand posts per second, spanning more than 20 languages.” DeepText is used in Facebook Messenger to detect intent—for instance, by allowing you to hail an Uber from within the app when you message “I need a ride” but not when you say, “I like to ride donkeys.” DeepText is also used for automating the removal of spam, helping popular public figures sort through the millions of comments on their posts to see those most relevant, identify for sale posts automatically and extract relevant information, and identify and surface content in which you might be interested.
                
            </P>
            <h3><span>2 – Instagram</span></h3>
            <P>Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012, uses machine learning to identify the contextual meaning of emoji, which have been steadily replacing slang (for instance, a laughing emoji could replace “lol”). By algorithmically identifying the sentiments behind emojis, Instagram can create and auto-suggest emojis and emoji hashtags. This may seem like a trivial application of AI, but Instagram has seen a massive increase in emoji use among all demographics, and being able to interpret and analyze it at large scale via this emoji-to-text translation sets the basis for further analysis on how people use Instagram.

            </P>
            <h3><span>3 - Snapchat</span></h3>
            <p>Snapchat introduced facial filters, called Lenses, in 2015. These filters track facial movements, allowing users to add animated effects or digital masks that adjust when their faces moved. This technology is  powered by the 2015 acquisition of Looksery (for a rumored $150 million), a Ukranian company with patents on using machine learning to track movements in video.</p>
